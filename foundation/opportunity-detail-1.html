			<p>In June our new smokehouse pizza will be hitting the shops. It’s already jumped through many product development hoops, and we’re now looking for 50 members and their friends who will make sure it lands just right.</p>

			<h4>The pizza</h4>
			<p>If you like your pizzas large and meaty, then we’re sure you’ll love this, which our Food chums describe thus…</p>
			
			<blockquote>’encircled in a toasted Cheddar crust and topped with sweet honey BBQ sauce are a trio of delicious smokehouse meats that pack quite a flavoursome punch’.</blockquote>

			<p>We think it could quickly become the staple fayre of a few Euro 2016 gatherings this summer, but there’s still time for a few final tweaks….and that’s where you come in.</p>

			<h4 id="instructions">What we’d like from you</h4>
			<p>If you think this sounds like the kind of heavenly offering that will most definitely be gracing your shopping basket in the future and you can collect from a store this Friday, you’re well on the way to meeting our Taste and Tell criteria.</p>

			<p>If you are successful in joining the test, we’ll give you two pizzas – one for you (you might want to share it mind you) – and one for you to give to a friend who’s also a Co-op member.</p>

			<p>We’d then like you both to complete a short online survey about how you found the pizza, and join an online discussion with some other members. We’ll use your feedback to inform any changes to the product before it hits the shops.</p>

			<p>If this sounds good, click the link below and answer a few questions about your taste preferences. We’re not looking for trained palates here, but we need to be sure that you fit the bill.</p>

			<p>We have a feeling that this opportunity will be quickly snapped up, so if you want to be amongst the first to sample our new smokehouse pizza, better not delay.</p>
