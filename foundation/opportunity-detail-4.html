The changes put members like you back at the heart of our Co-op. They bring exciting new ways in which we reward and connect with you and give you the chance to take part in things that make the co-op you own even better.</p>

			<p>We’ve involved many members in the development of our new member offer. They’ve helped us test, change and re-test ideas, and their feedback has led to us abandoning some stuff altogether.</p> 
			<h4>What we need from you</h4>
			<p>Right now we’d like to hear what you think of the new-look online member experience – chiefly, this hub. We’ll be using your feedback to help us tweak what we’ve done already and inform some new things we have in the pipeline.</p> 
			<p>We’re looking for 200 members who are happy to have a real delve around the member hub and then feedback their thoughts on what they find here. In the first instance, we’ll gather views through an online questionnaire, but then we’d also like you to join a discussion group in which you can bounce your ideas around with other members. We’d like to publish some of your comments, and, by way of a thank you, one lucky co-builder will receive £100 in their e-wallet.</p>
