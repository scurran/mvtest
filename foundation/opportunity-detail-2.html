			<p>We launched CLS in 2006 to offer individual customers a range of legal products and services that are underpinned by jargon-free customer service and transparent fees. And as a member, you might be very interested to learn you receive a discount of 5% on all of our legal services.</p>  

			<p>With thousands of highly satisfied customers, and satisfaction rates over 90% we know we’re getting it largely right, but we’re not ones to rest on our laurels. Right now we’re looking at how customers connect with the business and want to know what you think about our website in particular. With the help of members like you, we think we can deliver an online service that works better for everybody.</p> 

			<h4>What we need from you</h4>
			<p>We’re looking for 50 members to explore all corners of the site, come up with some views on what they think works well and could be working better.  You’ll then be asked to complete an online questionnaire about your experience and to join an online discussion group with other members and colleagues from CLS who will be looking to drill down into some of the emerging ideas.</p>

			<p>Before you sign up, maybe have a quick think about what you’d want to see if you were buying legal products online. We know it’s much more involved than shopping for groceries, and you’d probably be looking at a raft of considerations – price, trust, clear communication and openness to name but a few. Our challenge is to address these whilst making things as easy as they can be and maintaining a high quality service in which everyone has complete confidence. Can you help us hit that sweet spot?</p>
