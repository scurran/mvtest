      	<p>Our Member Council wants to find out how you’d like to connect with your co-op where you live. We’ve been trying out a few things in support of our purpose (in case you’ve not yet committed it to memory, it’s to champion a better way of doing business for you and your community).</p>
		<p>To put it simply, to do better things in your community we need you to help us. </p>
		<p>Our members have set up a number of Co-operative Local Forums, which are working hand in hand with local food stores and funeral homes to make good things happen in their local areas. They also allow members’ voices to be heard by the Member Council nationally.</p> 
		<p>We’re offering 70 members the chance to win £500 for their community by telling us what they think about these forums. Do they provide the connection with the co-op that would deliver great things where you live? If not, what else might you like to see?</p>
		<p>All you need to do is agree to go along to your next local forum and complete an online questionnaire. We’ll use the findings to help shape how we do things in your community going forward.</p>
