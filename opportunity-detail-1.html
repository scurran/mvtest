        <p><strong>By ‘eck, have we got an offer for you. Here’s your opportunity to get your hands on tickets for England’s Premier Agricultural Event (that’s how it’s billed at least, and who are we to argue?).</strong></p>

		<p>We’ve ten pairs of tickets to the Great Yorkshire Show up for grabs. All we need from you is a commitment to go along, find our Co-op Food stand, catch one of our fab cooking demonstrations and report back. You’ll be channelling your inner mystery shopper, photojournalist and blogger as you look at what we’re doing now and what we could do better in the future. 

		<h2>What’s involved?</h2>
		<p>There’s certain things that we’d like to know, so we’ll provide you with a few pointers for your assignment, but then it’s over to you to tell us about your experience and ideas. You might choose to do a video blog, a photo diary or put pen to paper – just pick your medium of choice. We’d like to publish bits of your report right here, so that other members will have chance to hear about your experience and comment on your ideas. We’ll also ensure that all your thoughts are fed back to colleagues who organise our Food presence at events like these. They’re keen to take on board the views of you and other members as they start to shape plans for next year’s calendar of outing.</p>

		<p>If you’re able to visit the show on Tuesday 12th July 2016, happy to document your experience, have us share it with other members and colleagues and take part in some follow up research, then click on the link below to be in the chance of winning a pair of tickets.*
